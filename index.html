        <h2 class="left title">Sea Level</h2>
        <p class="right"><strong>Global Sea Level Increase</strong><br>
            Since 1880, sea levels have risen by <strong>20-23 cm</strong>.<br>
            By <strong>2100</strong>, sea levels could rise by <strong>0.6 to 1.1 meters</strong> if global warming continues.
        </p>
        <p class="left"><strong>Impact on Coastal Populations</strong><br>
            Who’s at Risk?<br>
            <strong>600 million</strong> people live within <strong>10 meters</strong> of the current sea level.<br>
            By <strong>2050</strong>, <strong>150 million</strong> people might have to move due to flooding.<br>
            Major Cities in Danger<br>
            Cities like New York and Shanghai could face severe flooding!
        </p>
        <p class="right"><strong>Erosion & Habitat Loss</strong><br>
            <strong>20-25%</strong> of coastlines are eroding.<br>
            Mangroves and coral reefs are disappearing quickly, which are crucial for protecting our coasts!
        </p>
        <p class="left"><strong>Saltwater Intrusion</strong><br>
            Could affect <strong>1 billion</strong> people's drinking water.<br>
            Reduces crop yields by up to <strong>30%</strong>, which means less food!
        </p>
        <p class="right"><strong>Economic Impact</strong><br>
            What Could It Cost?<br>
            Small islands might lose up to <strong>80%</strong> of their land.

        <h2 class="right title">Biodiversity</h2>
        <p class="left"><strong>Genetic Variation Loss</strong><br>
            By <strong>2100</strong>, up to <strong>50%</strong> of species may lose genetic diversity, reducing their survival chances and harming ecosystems.
        </p>
        <p class="right"><strong>Plant Extinction</strong><br>
            By <strong>2050</strong>, <strong>20-30%</strong> of plant species risk extinction due to changing temperatures and rainfall.
        </p>
        <p class="left"><strong>Crop Yields</strong><br>
            Rising temperatures could cut crop yields by up to <strong>25%</strong> in some areas, endangering food security and biodiversity.

    <section class="section section-pollution">
        <h2>Pollution</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Air Pollution</strong><br>
            - <strong>7 million</strong> people die early each year due to polluted air, especially in South & East Asia.
        </p>
        <p><strong>2. Plastic Pollution</strong><br>
            - <strong>400 million tons</strong> of plastic are produced every year, with <strong>8 million tons</strong> ending up in the ocean.<br>
            - This results in the death of <strong>1 million seabirds</strong> and <strong>100,000 marine animals</strong> annually.<br>
            - Only <strong>9%</strong> of plastic is recycled.
        </p>
        <p><strong>3. Water Pollution</strong><br>
            - <strong>2 billion</strong> people lack access to clean drinking water, leading to diseases like cholera.<br>
            - Fertilizers cause rapid algae growth, which harms fish and plants.
        </p>
        <p><strong>4. Noise Pollution</strong><br>
            - Many cities exceed the safe noise level of <strong>55 decibels</strong>.
        </p>
        <p><strong>5. Greenhouse Gases</strong><br>
            - Human activities have already warmed the planet by <strong>1.1°C</strong>, increasing the risk of severe climate change.

    <section class="section section-glaciers">
        <h2>Glaciers</h2>
        <p><strong>Global Glacier Melt</strong><br>
            - <strong>267 gigatons</strong> of ice lost yearly over the last 20 years.<br>
            - Melting glaciers contribute to <strong>20-30%</strong> of sea level rise.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Most Affected Regions</strong><br>
            - <strong>Himalayas:</strong> Threatens water supply for <strong>1.3 billion</strong> people.<br>
            - <strong>Alps:</strong> Lost over <strong>50%</strong> of ice since 1850.<br>
            - <strong>Greenland & Antarctica:</strong> Greenland loses <strong>280 billion tons/year</strong>; Antarctica loses <strong>150 billion tons/year</strong>.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Causes of Glacier Melting</strong><br>
            - <strong>Black Carbon:</strong> Soot on ice accelerates melting.<br>
            - <strong>Feedback Loops:</strong> Melting exposes dark surfaces, which absorb more heat and speed up ice loss.
