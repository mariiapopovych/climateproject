    <section class="section section-pollution">
        <h2>Pollution</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Air Pollution</strong><br>
        Deaths: Air pollution causes about 7 million early deaths each year (WHO).<br>
        Sources: Factories, cars, burning fossil fuels, and home energy.<br>
        Affected Areas: South and East Asia have the worst air pollution.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>2. Plastic Pollution</strong><br>
        Production: 400 million tons of plastic are made yearly; 8 million tons end up in oceans.<br>
        Marine Impact: Over 1 million seabirds and 100,000 marine animals die yearly from plastic.<br>
        Recycling: Only 9% of plastic waste is recycled.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>3. Water Pollution</strong><br>
        Unsafe Water: 2 billion people lack safe drinking water, causing diseases like cholera.<br>
        Sources: Factory waste, farm runoff, and untreated sewage.<br>
        Eutrophication: Fertilizer pollution causes algae growth, depleting oxygen in water.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>4. Land Pollution</strong><br>
        Waste: Over 2 billion tons of solid waste are made yearly; 33% is not safely managed.<br>
        E-Waste: 50 million tons of electronic waste are produced yearly, containing harmful substances.
        </p>

        <p><strong>5. Noise Pollution</strong><br>
            Health: Long-term noise can cause hearing loss, heart issues, and stress.<br>
            Cities: Traffic and industrial noise in many cities exceed safe levels.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>6. Greenhouse Gas Emissions</strong><br>
            Emissions: The world emits about 50 billion tons of CO2-equivalent gases yearly.<br>
            Top Emitters: China (30%), the US (15%), and the EU (9%).<br>
            Temperature Rise: CO2 emissions have raised global temperatures by about 1.1°C since pre-industrial times.

        <section class="section section-glaciers">
            <h2>Glaciers</h2>
            <p><strong>1. Global Glacier Melt</strong><br>
            Ice Loss: Glaciers lose about 267 gigatons of ice yearly, with the rate doubling since the early 2000s.<br>
            Sea Level Rise: Melting glaciers cause 20-30% of the annual sea level rise.<br>
            Impact: If all glaciers melted, sea levels would rise by about 60 cm (2 feet).
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>2. Most Affected Regions</strong><br>
            Himalayas: Melting glaciers threaten water for 1.3 billion people in Asia.<br>
            Alps: European glaciers have lost over 50% of their volume since 1850.<br>
            Greenland and Antarctica: Greenland loses 280 billion tons of ice yearly, Antarctica 150 billion tons.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>3. Impacts of Glacier Melt</strong><br>
            Water Supply: Glaciers provide water during dry seasons; their loss threatens drinking water, farming, and hydropower.<br>
            Ecosystems: Melting glaciers harm freshwater ecosystems and cold-water species.<br>
            Natural Disasters: Melting can cause glacial lakes to burst, causing floods.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>4. Causes of Glacier Melting</strong><br>
            Rising Temperatures: Global warming is the main cause, with temperatures up by about 1.1°C since pre-industrial times.<br>
            Black Carbon: Soot from burning fuels settles on ice, speeding up melting.<br>
            Feedback Loops: Melting exposes darker surfaces, which absorb more heat and speed up melting.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>5. Future Trends</strong><br>
            Continued Loss: If temperatures keep rising, up to 90% of smaller glaciers could disappear by the end of the century.<br>
            Sea Level Impact: Continued melting could add 10-20 cm (4-8 inches) to sea levels by 2100, increasing flood risks.
