        <h2>Pollution</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Air Pollution</strong><br>
        Deaths Attributed: Air pollution contributes to an estimated 7 million premature deaths annually, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).<br>
        Major Sources: Emissions from industrial activities, vehicles, burning of fossil fuels, and household energy sources.<br>
        Most Affected Regions: South Asia and East Asia have the highest levels of particulate matter pollution (PM2.5), significantly exceeding safe levels.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>2. Plastic Pollution</strong><br>
        Production: Around 400 million tons of plastic are produced every year, and over 8 million tons end up in oceans annually.<br>
        Impact on Marine Life: Over 1 million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals die each year due to plastic pollution.<br>
        Recycling Rate: Only about 9% of all plastic waste ever produced has been recycled.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>3. Water Pollution</strong><br>
        Unsafe Drinking Water: Approximately 2 billion people globally lack access to safe drinking water, leading to diseases like cholera and diarrhea.<br>
        Pollution Sources: Industrial discharge, agricultural runoff (pesticides and fertilizers), and untreated sewage.<br>
        Eutrophication: Nutrient pollution from fertilizers leads to the excessive growth of algae, which depletes oxygen in water bodies and harms aquatic ecosystems.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>4. Land Pollution</strong><br>
        Waste Generation: The world generates over 2 billion tons of solid waste annually, with 33% not managed in an environmentally safe manner.<br>
        Electronic Waste (E-Waste): About 50 million tons of e-waste are produced each year, containing hazardous substances like lead and mercury.
        </p>

        <p><strong>5. Noise Pollution</strong><br>
            Health Impacts: Prolonged exposure to noise pollution can cause hearing loss, cardiovascular issues, and stress-related conditions.<br>
            Urban Areas: Traffic and industrial noise levels in many major cities exceed the recommended safe limit of 55 decibels during the day.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>6. Greenhouse Gas Emissions</strong><br>
            Global Emissions: The world emits roughly 50 billion tons of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gases annually.<br>
            Top Contributors: China (30%), the United States (15%), and the European Union (9%) are among the largest emitters.<br>
            Temperature Rise: Human-induced CO2 emissions have contributed to a global temperature rise of approximately 1.1Â°C since pre-industrial levels.
