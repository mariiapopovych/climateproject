    <section class="section section-sea-level">
        <h2>Sea Level</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Thermal Expansion</strong><br>
            As global temperatures rise, ocean water warms and expands. This is called thermal expansion and is
            responsible for a significant portion of sea-level rise. <br>
            Even a small increase in temperature can cause noticeable sea-level changes because the ocean covers over
            70% of Earth’s surface.
        <p><strong>2. Melting Ice Sheets and Glaciers</strong><br>
            <strong>Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets</strong> are melting at increasing rates due to rising global
            temperatures. <br>
            <strong> Mountain Glaciers</strong> around the world, especially in places like the Himalayas, Andes, and
            Alaska, are shrinking, adding water to the oceans. <br>

        <p><strong>3. Loss of Arctic Sea Ice</strong><br>
            While melting sea ice (floating ice) doesn’t directly increase sea levels, it contributes indirectly by
            altering ocean circulation and reducing the albedo effect, which amplifies warming and ice loss.

        <p><strong>4. Groundwater Depletion</strong><br>
            Human activities, such as excessive groundwater pumping for agriculture and drinking water, add to sea
            levels when this water eventually flows into the oceans.

        <p><strong>5. Regional Variations in Sea-Level Rise</strong><br>
            Sea-level rise is not uniform due to factors like gravitational pull, land subsidence, and ocean currents.

        <p><strong>6. Impacts of Sea-Level Rise</strong><br>
            <strong>Flooding and Erosion</strong> <br>
            <strong>Saltwater Intrusion</strong> <br>
            <strong>Displacement of Communities</strong> <br>
            <strong>Storm Surge Amplification</strong>

    <section class="section section-solar">
        <h2>Solar</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Contribution to Clean Energy Transition</strong><br>
            By replacing fossil fuel-based energy systems with solar-powered systems, we can reduce the carbon footprint
            of energy generation significantly.
        </p>
        <p><strong>2. Advancements in Solar Technology</strong><br>
            Photovoltaics (PV): Modern PV panels convert sunlight directly into electricity with high efficiency and
            decreasing costs.
        </p>
        <p><strong>3. Scalability and Accessibility</strong><br>
            Off-grid solar solutions are instrumental in providing energy to remote areas, reducing dependency on diesel
            generators and other polluting sources.
        </p>
        <p><strong>4. Mitigation of Climate Change Impacts</strong><br>
            It also reduces reliance on finite natural resources, such as coal and natural gas, which contribute to both
            climate change and environmental degradation.
        </p>
        <p><strong>5. Economic Benefits and Policy Incentives</strong><br>
            Solar energy fosters job creation in installation, manufacturing, and maintenance sectors, contributing to a
            green economy.
        </p>
        <p><strong>6. Challenges and Considerations</strong><br>
            <strong>Intermittency:</strong> Solar power depends on weather and daylight conditions, requiring solutions
            like energy
            storage or hybrid systems for reliability.<br>
            <strong>Land Use:</strong> Large solar farms may compete with other land uses, but innovations like
            agrivoltaics (combining
            agriculture and solar installations) address this.<br>
            <strong>Supply Chain Sustainability: </strong> The production of solar panels involves materials and
            processes that must be
            managed to minimize environmental and ethical impacts.

    <section class="section section-temperature">
        <h2>Temperature</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Global Warming and Greenhouse Gas Feedback</strong><br>
            Higher temperatures amplify feedback mechanisms, such as the release of methane from thawing permafrost,
            further accelerating climate change.
        <p><strong>2. Ice Melt and Albedo Effect</strong><br>
            Higher temperatures lead to the melting of polar ice caps, glaciers, and snow cover, reducing Earth's albedo
            (its reflectivity).
        <p><strong>3. Ocean Warming and Sea-Level Rise</strong><br>
            Ocean warming disrupts marine ecosystems, causes coral bleaching, and decreases the ocean's ability to
            absorb CO₂, intensifying atmospheric warming.
        <p><strong>4. Extreme Weather Events</strong><br>
            Warmer air holds more moisture, intensifying storms, while prolonged heat exacerbates droughts and
            wildfires.
        <p><strong>5. Ecosystem Disruptions</strong><br>
            Some species face extinction due to their inability to adapt to rapidly changing temperatures, reducing
            biodiversity.
        <p><strong>6. Human and Agricultural Impacts</strong><br>
            Rising temperatures stress water resources and reduce crop yields, particularly for temperature-sensitive
            crops like wheat, maize, and rice.

    <section class="section section-pollution">
        <h2>Pollution</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Air Pollution</strong><br>
            Deaths Attributed: Air pollution contributes to an estimated 7 million premature deaths annually, according
            to the World Health Organization (WHO).<br>
            Major Sources: Emissions from industrial activities, vehicles, burning of fossil fuels, and household energy
            sources.<br>
            Most Affected Regions: South Asia and East Asia have the highest levels of particulate matter pollution
            (PM2.5), significantly exceeding safe levels.
        </p>

        <p><strong>2. Plastic Pollution</strong><br>
            Production: Around 400 million tons of plastic are produced every year, and over 8 million tons end up in
            oceans annually.<br>
            Impact on Marine Life: Over 1 million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals die each year due to plastic
            pollution.<br>
            Recycling Rate: Only about 9% of all plastic waste ever produced has been recycled.
        </p>

        <p><strong>3. Water Pollution</strong><br>
            Unsafe Drinking Water: Approximately 2 billion people globally lack access to safe drinking water, leading
            to diseases like cholera and diarrhea.<br>
            Pollution Sources: Industrial discharge, agricultural runoff (pesticides and fertilizers), and untreated
            sewage.<br>
            Eutrophication: Nutrient pollution from fertilizers leads to the excessive growth of algae, which depletes
            oxygen in water bodies and harms aquatic ecosystems.
        </p>

        <p><strong>4. Land Pollution</strong><br>
            Waste Generation: The world generates over 2 billion tons of solid waste annually, with 33% not managed in
            an environmentally safe manner.<br>
            Electronic Waste (E-Waste): About 50 million tons of e-waste are produced each year, containing hazardous
            substances like lead and mercury.
        </p>

        <p><strong>5. Noise Pollution</strong><br>
            Health Impacts: Prolonged exposure to noise pollution can cause hearing loss, cardiovascular issues, and
            stress-related conditions.<br>
            Urban Areas: Traffic and industrial noise levels in many major cities exceed the recommended safe limit of
            55 decibels during the day.
        </p>

        <p><strong>6. Greenhouse Gas Emissions</strong><br>
            Global Emissions: The world emits roughly 50 billion tons of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gases annually.<br>
            Top Contributors: China (30%), the United States (15%), and the European Union (9%) are among the largest
            emitters.<br>
            Temperature Rise: Human-induced CO2 emissions have contributed to a global temperature rise of approximately
            1.1°C since pre-industrial levels.

    <section class="section section-glaciers">
        <h2>Glaciers</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Global Glacier Melt</strong><br>
            <strong>Rate of Ice Loss:</strong> Glaciers worldwide have been losing an average of approximately 267
            gigatons of ice per year over the past two decades. This rate has accelerated, with annual ice loss nearly
            doubling since the early 2000s.<br>
            <strong>Contribution to Sea Level Rise:</strong> Melting glaciers contribute significantly to global sea
            level rise. They are responsible for about 20-30% of the annual rise in sea levels.<br>
            <strong>Notable Impact:</strong> If all of Earth's glaciers melted, it is estimated that sea levels would
            rise by about 60 centimeters (2 feet), not including the ice in Greenland and Antarctica.
        </p>

        <p><strong>2. Most Affected Regions</strong><br>
            <strong>Himalayas:</strong> The Himalayan glaciers are melting at a rate that threatens the water supply for
            1.3 billion people in Asia who rely on rivers fed by glacier melt.<br>
            <strong>Alps:</strong> European glaciers, especially in the Alps, have lost over 50% of their volume since
            1850.<br>
            <strong>Greenland and Antarctica:</strong> These regions have seen some of the most dramatic ice loss, with
            Greenland shedding approximately 280 billion tons of ice per year, and Antarctica about 150 billion tons
            annually.
        </p>

        <p><strong>3. Impacts of Glacier Melt</strong><br>
            <strong>Water Supply:</strong> Glaciers act as natural water reservoirs, releasing water during dry seasons.
            Their reduction threatens drinking water, irrigation, and hydropower for millions.<br>
            <strong>Ecosystems:</strong> Melting glaciers affect freshwater ecosystems and can lead to habitat loss for
            certain cold-water species.<br>
            <strong>Natural Disasters:</strong> The melting of glaciers can lead to the formation of glacial lakes.
            Sudden outbursts from these lakes (known as Glacial Lake Outburst Floods, or GLOFs) can cause catastrophic
            flooding downstream.
        </p>

        <p><strong>4. Causes of Glacier Melting</strong><br>
            <strong>Rising Temperatures:</strong> Global warming is the primary driver, with the Earth’s temperature
            having risen by about 1.1°C since the pre-industrial era.<br>
            <strong>Black Carbon:</strong> Soot from burning fossil fuels and biomass settles on ice, reducing its
            albedo (reflectivity) and accelerating melting.<br>
            <strong>Feedback Loops:</strong> Melting exposes darker surfaces underneath, like rock or soil, which absorb
            more heat and speed up the melt in a feedback loop.
        </p>

        <p><strong>5. Projected Future Trends</strong><br>
            <strong>Continued Loss:</strong> If global temperatures continue to rise at current rates, up to 90% of
            smaller glaciers in the Alps, Rockies, and Andes could disappear by the end of the century.<br>
            <strong>Impact on Sea Level:</strong> Continued glacier melt could contribute an additional 10-20 cm (4-8
            inches) to sea level rise by 2100, further exacerbating coastal flooding risks.
