        <h2>Pollution</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Air Pollution</strong><br>
        Deaths Attributed: Air pollution contributes to an estimated 7 million premature deaths annually, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).<br>
        Major Sources: Emissions from industrial activities, vehicles, burning of fossil fuels, and household energy sources.<br>
        Most Affected Regions: South Asia and East Asia have the highest levels of particulate matter pollution (PM2.5), significantly exceeding safe levels.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>2. Plastic Pollution</strong><br>
        Production: Around 400 million tons of plastic are produced every year, and over 8 million tons end up in oceans annually.<br>
        Impact on Marine Life: Over 1 million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals die each year due to plastic pollution.<br>
        Recycling Rate: Only about 9% of all plastic waste ever produced has been recycled.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>3. Water Pollution</strong><br>
        Unsafe Drinking Water: Approximately 2 billion people globally lack access to safe drinking water, leading to diseases like cholera and diarrhea.<br>
        Pollution Sources: Industrial discharge, agricultural runoff (pesticides and fertilizers), and untreated sewage.<br>
        Eutrophication: Nutrient pollution from fertilizers leads to the excessive growth of algae, which depletes oxygen in water bodies and harms aquatic ecosystems.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>4. Land Pollution</strong><br>
        Waste Generation: The world generates over 2 billion tons of solid waste annually, with 33% not managed in an environmentally safe manner.<br>
        Electronic Waste (E-Waste): About 50 million tons of e-waste are produced each year, containing hazardous substances like lead and mercury.
        </p>

        <p><strong>5. Noise Pollution</strong><br>
            Health Impacts: Prolonged exposure to noise pollution can cause hearing loss, cardiovascular issues, and stress-related conditions.<br>
            Urban Areas: Traffic and industrial noise levels in many major cities exceed the recommended safe limit of 55 decibels during the day.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>6. Greenhouse Gas Emissions</strong><br>
            Global Emissions: The world emits roughly 50 billion tons of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gases annually.<br>
            Top Contributors: China (30%), the United States (15%), and the European Union (9%) are among the largest emitters.<br>
            Temperature Rise: Human-induced CO2 emissions have contributed to a global temperature rise of approximately 1.1°C since pre-industrial levels.

            <h2>Glaciers</h2>
            <p><strong>1. Global Glacier Melt</strong><br>
            <strong>Rate of Ice Loss:</strong> Glaciers worldwide have been losing an average of approximately 267 gigatons of ice per year over the past two decades. This rate has accelerated, with annual ice loss nearly doubling since the early 2000s.<br>
            <strong>Contribution to Sea Level Rise:</strong> Melting glaciers contribute significantly to global sea level rise. They are responsible for about 20-30% of the annual rise in sea levels.<br>
            <strong>Notable Impact:</strong> If all of Earth's glaciers melted, it is estimated that sea levels would rise by about 60 centimeters (2 feet), not including the ice in Greenland and Antarctica.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>2. Most Affected Regions</strong><br>
            <strong>Himalayas:</strong> The Himalayan glaciers are melting at a rate that threatens the water supply for 1.3 billion people in Asia who rely on rivers fed by glacier melt.<br>
            <strong>Alps:</strong> European glaciers, especially in the Alps, have lost over 50% of their volume since 1850.<br>
            <strong>Greenland and Antarctica:</strong> These regions have seen some of the most dramatic ice loss, with Greenland shedding approximately 280 billion tons of ice per year, and Antarctica about 150 billion tons annually.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>3. Impacts of Glacier Melt</strong><br>
            <strong>Water Supply:</strong> Glaciers act as natural water reservoirs, releasing water during dry seasons. Their reduction threatens drinking water, irrigation, and hydropower for millions.<br>
            <strong>Ecosystems:</strong> Melting glaciers affect freshwater ecosystems and can lead to habitat loss for certain cold-water species.<br>
            <strong>Natural Disasters:</strong> The melting of glaciers can lead to the formation of glacial lakes. Sudden outbursts from these lakes (known as Glacial Lake Outburst Floods, or GLOFs) can cause catastrophic flooding downstream.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>4. Causes of Glacier Melting</strong><br>
            <strong>Rising Temperatures:</strong> Global warming is the primary driver, with the Earth’s temperature having risen by about 1.1°C since the pre-industrial era.<br>
            <strong>Black Carbon:</strong> Soot from burning fossil fuels and biomass settles on ice, reducing its albedo (reflectivity) and accelerating melting.<br>
            <strong>Feedback Loops:</strong> Melting exposes darker surfaces underneath, like rock or soil, which absorb more heat and speed up the melt in a feedback loop.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>5. Projected Future Trends</strong><br>
            <strong>Continued Loss:</strong> If global temperatures continue to rise at current rates, up to 90% of smaller glaciers in the Alps, Rockies, and Andes could disappear by the end of the century.<br>
            <strong>Impact on Sea Level:</strong> Continued glacier melt could contribute an additional 10-20 cm (4-8 inches) to sea level rise by 2100, further exacerbating coastal flooding risks.
