        <p class="right"><span class="highlight-orange">Contribution to Clean Energy Transition</span><br>
            By replacing fossil fuel-based energy systems with solar-powered systems, we can reduce the carbon footprint
            of energy generation significantly.
        </p>
        <p class="left"><span class="highlight-orange">Advancements in Solar Technology</span><br>
            Photovoltaics (PV): Modern PV panels convert sunlight directly into electricity with high efficiency and
            decreasing costs.
        </p>
        <p class="right"><span class="highlight-orange">Scalability and Accessibility</span><br>
            Off-grid solar solutions are instrumental in providing energy to remote areas, reducing dependency on diesel
            generators and other polluting sources.
        </p>
        <p class="left"><span class="highlight-orange">Mitigation of Climate Change Impacts</span><br>
            It also reduces reliance on finite natural resources, such as coal and natural gas, which contribute to both
            climate change and environmental degradation.

        <p class="left"><span>1. Air Pollution</span><br>
            - <span>7 million</span> people die early each year due to polluted air, especially in South & East Asia.
        </p>
        <p class="right"><span>2. Plastic Pollution</span><br>
            - <span>400 million tons</span> of plastic are produced every year, with <span>8 million tons</span> ending up in the ocean.<br>
            - This results in the death of <span>1 million seabirds</span> and <span>100,000 marine animals</span> annually.<br>
            - Only <span>9%</span> of plastic is recycled.
        </p>
        <p class="left"><span>3. Water Pollution</span><br>
            - <span>2 billion</span> people lack access to clean drinking water, leading to diseases like cholera.<br>
            - Fertilizers cause rapid algae growth, which harms fish and plants.
        </p>
        <p class="right"><span>4. Noise Pollution</span><br>
            - Many cities exceed the safe noise level of <span>55 decibels</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="left"><span>5. Greenhouse Gases</span><br>
            - Human activities have already warmed the planet by <span>1.1°C</span>, increasing the risk of severe climate change.

            - <span>267 gigatons</span> of ice lost yearly over the last 20 years.<br>
            - Melting glaciers contribute to <span>20-30%</span> of sea level rise.
        </p>
        <p class="left"><span>Most Affected Regions</span><br>
            - <span>Himalayas:</span> Threatens water supply for <span>1.3 billion</span> people.<br>
            - <span>Alps:</span> Lost over <span>50%</span> of ice since 1850.<br>
            - <span>Greenland & Antarctica:</span> Greenland loses <span>280 billion tons/year</span>; Antarctica loses <span>150 billion tons/year</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="right"><span>Causes of Glacier Melting</span><br>
            - <span>Black Carbon:</span> Soot on ice accelerates melting.<br>
            - <span>Feedback Loops:</span> Melting exposes dark surfaces, which absorb more heat and speed up ice loss.
